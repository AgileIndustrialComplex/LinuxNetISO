## girlfriends - Pretty Mouth lyrics
I'm all out of adrenaline\
I'm under pressure again\
I guess it all went to hell\
When did it stop making sense?\
Cut myself open, now I'm starting to bleed\
I can't fake a smile when you lie through your teeth, oh-woah\
You're so overrated\
Selfish, I fucking hate it\
You know me better than anyone else\
And you still hate me\
Broke my own heart just to see how it felt\
Nothing can save me\
I'm just a sucker for words from a pretty mouth\
What do you gotta say for yourself?\
'Cause you know me better than anyone else\
And you still hate me\
I got a question\
How come I didn't hear that you weren't interested\
From your mouth?\
You spilt a gram of coke all over my couch (what the fuck?)\
In my house\
I hope whoever you find is just as out of their mind as you now\
'Cause you break down\
A taste of your own medicine, one that you can't wash out\
You know me better than anyone else\
And you still hate me\
Broke my own heart just to see how it felt\
Nothing can save me\
I'm just a sucker for words from a pretty mouth\
What do you gotta say for yourself?\
'Cause you know me better than anyone else\
And you still hate me\
Did they hate Shakespeare\
As much as you hate Morrissey? (I hate that you hate Morrissey)\
Overrated\
Overdramatic\
Piece of shit that sounds just like me\
That sounds just like me (just like me)\
You know me better than anyone else (you know me)\
And you still hate me\
Broke my own heart just to see how it felt (see how it felt)\
Nothing can save me\
I'm just a sucker for words from a pretty mouth (pretty mouth)\
What do you gotta say for yourself?\
'Cause you know me better than anyone else (you know me)\
And you still hate me\
You know me better than anyone else\
And you still hate me\
You know me better than anyone else\
And you still hate me\
